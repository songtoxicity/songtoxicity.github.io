# Background

This project explores the relationship between song lyric toxicity and factors, such as genre and gender. It was originally completed for [Stand Up Boston](https://standupboston.org/), a workshop aimed at empowering people to stand up against sexual misconduct. The data exploration and presentation was done by [Irene Chen](https://twitter.com/irenetrampoline), [Marzyeh Ghassemi](https://twitter.com/marzyehghassemi), and [Deborah Hanus](https://twitter.com/deborahhanus).
