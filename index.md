### Background

This is a project exploring the relationship between lyric toxicity and several other factors, such as genre and gender. It was originally completed for [Stand Up Boston](https://standupboston.org/), a workshop aimed at empowering people to stand up against sexual misconduct. The data exploration and presentation was done by [Irene Chen](https://twitter.com/irenetrampoline), [Marzyeh Ghassemi](https://twitter.com/marzyehghassemi), and [Deborah Hanus](https://twitter.com/deborahhanus).  

### Data 

We used a dataset publically available from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/gyani95/380000-lyrics-from-metrolyrics), which we augmented with information about artist gender scraped from []().
